    "This report is divided in two parts. In the first part, we present our solution to the problem of formulating an instance of the kakuro puzzle [1] as an integer programming problem. In the second part we present a formulation of the integer partition problem also as an integer programming problem. As we have seen during lecture, an integer program is a linear program where all the variables have integrality constraints. Although integer programming is know to be NP-complete, the the Gurobi Optimizer is capable of solving such models using state-of-the-art mathematics and computer science [2]. We use the Python API provided with the Gurobi Optimizer to formulate and solve the problems. The jupyter notebook containing the code for the aasignment is available at [3].\n",
    "\n",
    "# Solving an instance of Kakuro with integer programming\n",
    "\n",
    "The rules of the kakkuro puzzle [1] are simple:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Each cell can contain integers from 1 through 9\n",
    "2. The clues in the black cells tell the sum of the numbers next to that clue. (on the right or down)\n",
    "3. The numbers in consecutive white cells must be unique.\n",
    "\n",
    "The specific instance that we we solve here is given in image below.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/kakuro_instance.png\" width=200, height=200>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model Formulation\n",
    "\n",
    "### Decision variables\n",
    "\n",
    "We choose to number the cells from top to bottom, left to right starting from $1$. Thus the decision variables for this model are given by $assign_{ijv}$ for $(i,j,v) \\in \\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}^2 \\times \\{1,\\dots,9\\}$. If $assign_{ijv} = 1$ then the cell with coordinates $(i,j)$ is assigned the value $v$, otherwise $assign_{ijv} = 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Constraints\n",
    "\n",
    "The indications in the rules each give rise to some constraints. Fisrtly, since each cell must be assigned exactly one number we know that for all blank cells $(i,j)$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sum_{v=1}^{9} assign_{ijv} = 1$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, if two cells $(i,j)$ and $(k,l)$ belong to the same horizontal or vertical summation group then they must have different values assigned to each of them. We express this constraint as follow:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$assign_{ijv} + assign_{klv} \\leq 1$$\n",
    "\n",
    "for each $v$. The inequality means that the value $v$ may not be assigned to any of the two cells under consideration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, there are the constraints generated from the clues in the black cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "We begin by importing the Gurobi Python Module. Then we initialize some data structures with the given data.\n"
